# [Single character palindromes II](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a66ea69e6be38219f000110) #

In this Kata, you will check if it is possible to convert a string to a palindrome by changing one character.

### For instance: ###

    solve ("abbx") = True, because we can convert 'x' to 'a' and get a palindrome. 
    solve ("abba") = False, because we cannot get a palindrome by changing any character. 
    solve ("abcba") = True. We can change the middle character. 
    solve ("aa") = False 
    solve ("ab") = True
