# [Keypad horror](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5572392fee5b0180480001ae) #

Having two standards for a keypad layout is inconvenient!

Solve the horror of unstandardized keypads by providing a function that converts computer input to a number as if it was typed on a phone.

Example:
"789" -> "123"

Notes:
You get a string with numbers only
