# [What's my golf score?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f7a0a77eb74bf96b00006a) #

I have the par value for each hole on a golf course and my stroke score on each hole. I have them stored as strings, because I wrote them down on a sheet of paper. Right now, I'm using those strings to calculate my golf score by hand: take the difference between my actual score and the par of the hole, and add up the results for all 18 holes.

### For example: ###

* If I took 7 shots on a hole where the par was 5, my score would be: 7 - 5 = 2

* If I got a hole-in-one where the par was 4, my score would be: 1 - 4 = -3.

Doing all this math by hand is really hard! Can you help make my life easier?
